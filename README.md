## Overview and origin
Wealthsimple was founded in Toronto in September 2014 by Michael Katchen who is currently the CEO of the company. Michael Katchen originally worked for 1000Memories, which was a Silicon Valley-based start-up. In 2012, Katchen was simply putting together a spreadsheet with tips for his colleagues to set up investment portfolios and Voilà! The inspiration for Wealthsimple was born. Thereafter, he returned to Toronto to launch his company in September 2014.  

In December 2015, Wealthsimple was able to merge with Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc. (a Canadian order-execution broker-dealer), thus becoming one of Canada’s 14 discount brokerages. This acquisition created competition with other discount brokerages including Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Bank of Montreal (BMO).  

Initially, the company raised $1.9 million CAD in May 2014 from Eric Kirzner, Joe Canavan, and Roger Martin. Then, in April 2015, Wealthsimple received $10 million CAD from Power Finanical Corporation in an agreement that allowed for a future investment of $20 million in 12 months. Fast forward to November 2021 the firm holds over $15 billion in assets under management. It is primarily owned by Power Corporation indirectly at 70.1% through investments they made through their holdings in Power Financial, IGM Financial and Portag3. This shows how much the company has grown since it launched in 2014. 
## Business Activities
Prior to digitalization of investments, investment companies traditionally targeted people over the age of 45 to join the investment playground. However, Katchen, Wealthsimple’s CEO had a vision to bring a younger crowd into the world of investment. In an interview Katchen explains “Millennials are missing out on opportunities to secure their financial future. A lot of young people are mistrustful of big banks and put off by the paperwork. We are combining financial expertise with smart IT to shake up the industry and modernize investment.”. 

Millennials are currently the adult population consisting of people born from 1981-1996 (ages 26-41). This age group is very comfortable with social media and new technology. This generation has also faced financial difficulties that generations before them have not experienced. Many people in this generation are still paying off student debt acquired due to pursuing post-secondary degrees. While entry-level positions may not always have high salaries, meaning most of the average millennial’s paychecks go to debt payments, credit cards and living expenses meanwhile not leaving much for non-essentials. (Investopedia) Therefore, this company has targeted the ideal demographic for it’s financial services due to the low fees and easy access via technology. While the main targeted demographic is millennials the Wealthsimple financial services are easily available to most age groups with access to a phone and their mobile app.  

The financial problem Wealthsimple is trying to solve is using technology to automate the investment process while keeping costs low for its consumers. It also makes it easily accessible especially to the millennial population by providing a simple mobile app for managing their portfolio. 

In Wealthsimple words they strive in “providing smart, simple investing without the high fees and account minimums associated with traditional investment management. We invest your money in a globally diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, and our cutting-edge technology helps you earn the best possible return, while optimizing your tax bill. This means we do things like automatic rebalancing, dividend reinvesting, and tax loss harvesting- services that were only available to the ultra-rich until now or that most people found too tedious to do on their own.”. Wealthsimple also provides financial experts to help with and customer inquiries. The company has also introduced other nifty features to their financial services that help people reach their goals and manage their money. These features include high interest savings, commission free trading, automatically investing the client’s spare change helping them save for the future. 

While Wealthsimple is competing with other companies in its domain from the United State such as Betterment or Canada such as Questrade, the company is offering services that are comparable or even competitive with these companies. The services and advantages that Wealthsimple offers include no account minimum to sign-up, no account fees, five available portfolios, socially responsible portfolio (SRI) option, tax strategy, automatic rebalancing, human advisor option, savings and cash management amount, and customer support options. When comparing Wealthsimple to its competitors there are features that the company offers that are similar/comparable such as the no account minimum. However, where Wealthsimple is unique is that it offers SRIs (removes investments in controversial companies like fossil fuels, tobacco and weaponry), a Shariah compliant portfolio (halal- complies with Islamic law), free portfolio review, investment of fractional shares (buys fractional shares of ETFs instead of staying in low-interest-bearing cash until there’s enough for a full share), and  access to a team of financial advisors. 

The technologies that Wealthsimple use includes Javascript, Java, React, PostgreSQL, Ruby, TensorFlow, a range of Google analytics, Amazon S3 among many others. Stackshare shows a total of 61 tools used to run their business. This wide array of technologies allows the company to run an efficient and growing fintech company.
## Landscape
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99312687/156112944-f04e1eb9-9b8c-4814-9aa1-8c993f0f3a4d.png" width="300" height="200">

Wealthsimple provides a variety of financial services. The company provides a robo-advisory platform for investments and trading stacks and cryptocurrencies. As wealthsimple has expanded it has added peer to peer cash transfers and offers savings and investment accounts for their clients.  

Robo-advisory is a domain that millennials have been known to show a higher interest in, especially those with extra funds to invest. However, even with this adoption there is still substantial room for growth. Robo advice may have been perceived to be more for clients new to investing or clients with low investable assets but is now showing to appeal to a younger and wealthier crowd. About 15% of Generation X are using robo advisors. (backendbenchmarking) Robo advisors are intangible algorithms that help build a diversified portfolio based on your profit-risk preferences. Robo advisory has sustained its growth even within the pandemic. It’s been noted that the market size has increased from $827 billion assets under management to 987$ from 2019-2020. 

Trends that have appeared in the robo-advisory domain are hybrid robo-advisors, advance features, banks entering the niche, and consolidation. Hybrid robo-advisors is a solution to help personalize the use of the domain. Hybrid model are when managers use robo-advisory to rebalance portfolios, allocate assets and optimize client experience therefore providing more client-focused wealth management services. While this domain was offering initially basic investment options, such as low-cost ETFs, automatic rebalancing, and sustainability analysis, artificial intelligence (AI) robo-advisors are now solving more complex tasks with improved algorithms. These include needs-based planning, next-best-action, and retirement income planning, some of which Wealthsimple has adopted. Another trend noted is that banks are entering the niche in order to appeal to the millennials. However it also allows banks to offer long term investment options with moderate risk for other group clients and potentially keep regulars with the bank by introducing these new features. Finally, consolidation has been a popular trend which includes either mergers or takeovers. For example, Schwab completed a TD Ameritrade takeover. Meanwhile, Wealthsimple merged with Mint allowing for more services under one umbrella thereby increasing accessibility. 

Major companies in the domain that are American include Betterment, Wealthfront, Vangaurd Digital Advisor, and Schwab intelligent portfolios. Meanwhile competitors of Wealthsimple in this domain in Canada are a mix of fintech companies and larger banks. These competitors include BMO Smartfolio, CI Direct Investing, iA WealthAssist, Justwealth, Nest Wealth, Questwealth, RBC InvestEase, Smart Money Invest, and VirtualWealth. These companies provide a variety of services and investment options and the leading competitors in robo-advisory in Canada according to MoneySense. 
## Results
Wealthsimple has grown in success throughout the years in the fintech world. The company has been able to expand their company by adding financial services and options, merging with other fintech companies, working on future projects for the company and managing more and more assets every year. 
## Recommendations

This company is doing well in the Canadian market when it comes to robo-advisory as a platform for investments and trading stocks, however there are still improvements to be made. Two recommendations would include to expand the access of international U.S stocks available on their trading platform and to expand their blockchain and cryptocurrency involvement, for example adding a crypto wallet. As a user of Wealthsimple, I found there were many U.S stocks that I wanted to add to my portfolio but were not available on Wealthsimple’s platform. This would expand the use of their app and company since limited access to stock can deter avid stock traders and perhaps use a competitor such as Questrade. In addition, blockchain and cryptocurrency appears to be the future of fintech, thus expanding on this domain would help build and grow the company with the changing fintech market, keeping Wealthsimple relevant and competitive in the field. 

Wealthsimple is an innovative company and is working on implementing the very recommendations suggested for the company. Recently on December 8, 2021, the company announced that for $10 per month using their plus option, clients can sell all U.S. stocks on the market with no commission and no foreign-exchange fees on trade. (Wealthsimple site) This will help draw in more Canadian millennials looking to trade internationally, specifically the U.S., without restrictions and will keep current clients looking to expand their portfolio with Wealthsimple. 

Regarding blockchain and cryptocurrency, Wealthsimple has already added the capability of trading crypto in August 2020 with Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as adding more coins since this time. In addition, has hosted wallets and inward transfer capabilities, but is looking to enable withdrawals in the future. This future leap will prove to come with challenges for the company including unexpected costs and uncertain regulatory terrain. 

Wealthsimple contains a lot of technology they could potentially use to make these changes a reality, since programs such as Java are so universal. However, perhaps adding a program such as Python will give them the edge to create the programming necessary for these next steps. Python has ruled the world of app development and is proving to be an asset in blockchain development. Some of the feature offered to aid in blockchain development include being easy to learn in blockchain programming, access to dynamic architecture, perfect for base and scripting approaches, open-source support, and blockchain coding efficiency for prototyping. Thus, a useful tool for Wealthsimple to incorporate into their current use of technologies.

All in all, Weathsimple is a known name in the Fintech world in robo-advisory and has grown massively since it was first launching in 2014. The vision and innovation of the company to allow anyone maintain financial independence with their services is a valuable part of the Canadian Fintech world today.
